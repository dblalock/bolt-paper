	abstract = {We introduce ternary weight networks (TWNs) - neural networks with weights constrained to +1, 0 and -1. The Euclidian distance between full (ﬂoat or double) precision weights and the ternary weights along with a scaling factor is minimized. Besides, a threshold-based ternary function is optimized to get an approximated solution which can be fast and easily computed. TWNs have stronger expressive abilities than recently proposed binary precision counterparts and are more effective than the latter. Meanwhile, TWNs achieve up to 16⇥ or 32⇥ model compression rate and need fewer multiplications compared with the full precision counterparts. Benchmarks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and large scale ImageNet datasets show that the performance of TWNs is only slightly worse than the full precision counterparts but outperforms the analogous binary precision counterparts a lot.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01064},
	abstract = {Deep neural networks are widely used in machine learning applications. However, the deployment of large neural networks models can be difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited power budgets. To solve this problem, we propose Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ), a method that can reduce the precision of weights in neural networks to ternary values. This method has very little accuracy degradation and can even improve the accuracy of some models (32, 44, 56-layer ResNet) on CIFAR-10 and AlexNet on ImageNet. And our AlexNet model is trained from scratch, which means it's as easy as to train normal full precision model. We highlight our trained quantization method that can learn both ternary values and ternary assignment. During inference, only ternary values (2-bit weights) and scaling factors are needed, therefore our models are nearly 16x smaller than full-precision models. Our ternary models can also be viewed as sparse binary weight networks, which can potentially be accelerated with custom circuit. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the ternary models obtained by trained quantization method outperform full-precision models of ResNet-32,44,56 by 0.04\%, 0.16\%, 0.36\%, respectively. On ImageNet, our model outperforms full-precision AlexNet model by 0.3\% of Top-1 accuracy and outperforms previous ternary models by 3\%.},
