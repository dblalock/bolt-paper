\subsection{Softmax Classifier}
% ------------------------------------------------

Resnet-56 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100

maybe actually get a ton of these softmaxes on these 2 datasets and make a bunch of subplots
    -this would end up being kind of our main quantitative result

\subsection{Image Processing}
% ------------------------------------------------

Maybe just all the images from Caltech-101
    -because high resolution, pretty standard, and not too many images
        -fewer images = easier to work with than imagenet
            -and don't need 1M of them to get a good comparison of methods

    -probably just vertical filters of different sizes
